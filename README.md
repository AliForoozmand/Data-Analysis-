## Data-Analysis-
This repository contains assignments, projects, and notes from the Data Analysis Class conducted by Prof. Francine Marleau at the university of Innsbruck. The class explores the foundational and advanced techniques of data processing, focusing on their applications in experimental physics and beyond.

Course Overview
The topics covered in this course include:

Theory of Statistics: Statistical distributions, tests, and trend analysis with examples from social sciences.
Nonparametric Tests: Including Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon, Kendall's Tau, and others.
Fitting of Data: Techniques for data fitting and creating arbitrary random number generators for general distributions.
Error Estimation: Gaussian error propagation, nonlinear mapping, and error handling for non-normally distributed data.
Nyquist-Shannon Theories: The regular theory and extensions for fitting data in extended measurement intervals.
Fourier and Regularization Methods: Applied to image recognition, image sharpening, and signal-background separation.
Time Series Analysis: Techniques for analyzing and processing time-dependent data.
Parallel Data Processing: Amdahl's Law, paradigms, and practical exercises in parallel systems.
Relevance
As a student of astrophysics at the University of Innsbruck, this class has been instrumental in expanding my understanding of statistical and computational methods. These techniques are vital for interpreting experimental data in physics, astrophysics, and even industrial applications. The skills developed here will also aid in addressing broader industrial and social challenges.
